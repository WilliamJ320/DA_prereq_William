    "in Music Performance and I'm looking to diversify my skillsets into the tech field. I spend a good amount of time touring with my band DOOMGONG so I like the versatility that working a remote tech job could offer. Through this program I am looking to learn the skills that would help me do things like inventory management and maybe segue into more marketing trend tracking. I'm open to many things though! I look forward to working with all of you. "
